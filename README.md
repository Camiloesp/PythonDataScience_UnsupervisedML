# 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python

This repository contains my notes, projects, and exercises from the [Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-in-python-unsupervised-learning/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) course.  

The course dives deep into clustering, dimensionality reduction, and other core unsupervised learning techniques using Python. Topics covered include:

- 📊 **Clustering Algorithms**: K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN  
- 🔎 **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE  
- 🛠️ **Practical Applications**: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, recommendation systems
