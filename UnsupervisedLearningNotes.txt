Unsupervised Learning Techniques:
There are two popular categories of unsupervised learning techniques:
- Clustering: Identifying groups (or clusters) of data points that are similar to one another but distinct from other groups.
	Common Techniques:
	- K-Means Clustering.
	- Hierarchical Clustering.
	- DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
	
	Applications:
	- Clustering / Segmentation.
	- Anomaly Detection. Identiying rare points in a data set that deviate significantly from the rest.
		- Clustering Techniques.
		- Isolation Forests.
	- Recommenders.Suggesting items to users based on their preferences or behaviors.
		- Clustering Techniques
		- Dimensionality Reduction Techniques.

- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of columns (or dimensions) in a data set while losing as little information as possible.
	Common Techniques:
	- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
	- t-SNE (t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
	- SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

	Applications:
	- Feature Extraction.
	- Data Visualization.
	- Recommenders.

Data Science Workflow. This is non-linear
1) Scoping a project
2) Gathering data
3) Cleaning data
4) Exploring data
5) Modeling data
6) Sharing insights

Unsupervised Learning Workflow: This is also non-linear from step 1,2 and 3.
1) Data Prep: Get your data ready to be input into a model.
	- Single table, non-null, numeric data.
	- Feature engineering, selection, and scaling.
2) Algorithm: Apply an unsupervised learning technique.
	- Clustering.
	- Dimensinality Reduction.
3) Tuning: Evaluate & tune the model using metrics and intuition.
	- Metrics (i.e. inertia)
	- Data visualization.
	- Interpret the results.
4) Selection: Pick the best results & identify any insights.
	- Business objective.
	- Domain expertise.
